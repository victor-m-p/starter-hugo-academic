# Biography
I am a PhD student at the Complexity Science Hub, Vienna. I work on belief networks and am particularly interested in how beliefs (personal and social) constrain the dynamics of beliefs and behaviors. A key idea is that structural features of individual belief networks (personal and social) predict different dynamical patterns.

Previously I worked as a Predoctoral Fellow with prof. Simon DeDeo (CMU/SFI) on machine learning approaches to cultural-historical data, and was a research consultant for the London School of Economics (LSE) on a project for the Database of Religious History (DRH). 

Overall, my research interests span cognitive science, complex systems research, and computational modeling of social and cultural systems. I also write and release music as Löwenmensch.
