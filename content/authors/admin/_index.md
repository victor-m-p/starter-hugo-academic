I am a predoctoral fellow at the Laboratory for Social Minds at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests span cognitive science, complex systems research, and computational modeling of social and cultural systems. I am currently working on Machine Learning (ML) approaches to modeling biased, inconsistent, and incomplete social and cultural data with prof. Simon DeDeo (CMU/SFI).
